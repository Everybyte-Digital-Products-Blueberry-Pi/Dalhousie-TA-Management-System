Why do we need a TA management system from a professor perspective?

- Professor already have myCarrer to hiring TA, but what they can get is a very plain CV from applicants.
So a database to track performance of TA and do some analysis to provide a deep insight into the applicants for proferssor.
professor will not making decisions only by reading transcripts and CV, more data will help to make the decision making easier

- During the course, there is nothing to keep track of the TA's activities and evaluate their working but straight up communication.
We don't know if the number of the TAs hired might be too much or not enough for the workload of the course, are they working efficiently?
It would be more convenient to have something that keep track of their work and evaluate it.

- Current TA feedback system is not very suitable for the evaluation of the TA, using the similar question template with the prof.
There should be more specific data about TAs.
----------------
Some components/ideas that could be implemented:

 Thus, there should be a new database or extension to the existing database to record the TA's performence. Therefore more TA's data
will be used, and most of these data is not being recorded in the current system.
=> there should have several parameters such as: grade of course TA experience before, result of his last experience.

- Tracking TA's activities during the course (Need to know more about the work in a course, what a professor's expectation on a TA)

- A TA feedback system to evaluate the TAs

---------------
How do we track TA works during the course? What kind of data should be tracked? (Not yet solved)
