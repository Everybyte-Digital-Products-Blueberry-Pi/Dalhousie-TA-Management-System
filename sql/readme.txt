If you're using a tool like MAMP to run the project, you'll neeed to setup the database for the hour submission 
functionality to work. 
To get the database set up:
- Open phpMyAdmin
- Create a new database called 'nhat'
- import the two tables provided in this folder (status.sql and form.sql)

You should then be able to get the functionality working.
